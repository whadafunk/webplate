# Vanilla webtemplates

![wallpaper](./wallpaper.jpg)

A couple of WebTemplates that I use in various labs or testing situations
I used these to test webdeployment with different cloud providers, or to bring up  
quickly a couple of websites in my lab.

These templates are not built by me, and the credits for the rights owners
can be found in links and text paragraphs where the owners intended for them
to appear.

## Content

* aitone
* breadfactory
* coffeewebsite
* cookingrecipe
* snack
* vertical-epilogue
* vertical-introspect
* zerotype


## Instructions

The templates are splitted by branches, and all of them are merged on master branch. 
The ideea being that if you don't want to waste bandwidth, you can fetch only 
one branch and do your thing.
